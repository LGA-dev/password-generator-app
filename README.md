## General info

I had a lot of fun making this project.

Some of the things I have learned with this project are how to use **addEventListener** to target certain events and add/remove classes with **classList**. With this, I was able to add or delete data within an array based on active checkboxes.

Also I updated this project with SASS, so the CSS is a bit less bloated now.
